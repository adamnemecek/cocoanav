ItemTableView shows all [CNItem](CNItem.md)s. The topright search box is linked to it.

ItemTableView uses 2 custom cells to draw its contents.
  * the first one draws the left column and displays stuff like 'protocol MyProtocol for MyObject'
  * the second one draws the other columns, it's purely cosmetic : smaller font and only framework name instead of framework path
