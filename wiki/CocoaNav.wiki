CocoaNav reads framework in /System and displays them visually in a Core Animation view while making them searchable.

CocoaNav is mostly written in RubyCocoa, with two ObjectiveC classes : CNItem and FrameworkViewBackground. It's a document based app.

=== Model and controllers ===
 * ApplicationController manages data : handles FrameworkParsing, preferences, computing the ClassTree, WalkingTheTree, and FrameworkColors
 * CNItem is the all purpose data class : it stores parsed class names, methods, protocols and categories 
 * Windows are backed by CNDocument : specifies DocumentType and UserFrameworks
 * FrameworkColor : CoreData class for managing text and background colors of frameworks

=== Windows ===
* CNWindow is the main window : handles coordination between the 3 views : FrameworkView, CrumbView, ItemTableView
* CNAboutWindow : the about window showing a WebView, backed by a Core Animation Quartz Composition
* CNPreferencesWindow : handles FrameworkColors editing

=== Views ===
* FrameworkViewBackground : draws a radial gradient as a background. This class exists because I couldn't figure out how to draw the gradient with RubyCocoa
* FrameworkView : the meat of what you'll see. For each Objective C class, creates a matching layer. Two view modes : framework (classes inside their frameworks) or ClassTree (classes linked to their parents)
* CrumbView : for each class, draws inheritance crumb. For NSButton, draws NSObject > NSResponder > NSControl > NSButton. 
* ItemTableView : displays every framework/class/method/protocol/category loaded and search them
